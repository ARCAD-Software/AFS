The ARCAD Foundation services propose a technical base build as an OSGi framework. Each service, function or API are embedded into a Bundle, even if some can be used into "plain java applications".

## Risks and Returns

This framework is based on the OSGi platform and the Restlet framework, it will confere the following main features *out of the box* :

* **Component oriented development**: highly modular, dynamic and extendable framework.
* **SOA**: The AFS framework is Service oriented, this mean that it include web-services (REST), and internal Service architecture (OSGi) and is compatible with a micro-service architecture (or into and Agent oriented architecture).
* **Compatible**: your project is compatible, even ''embedded'', with other projects developed with AFS. As far as possible, every feature and external tool included into the AFS deliveries are compatible with each other.
* **Secured**: Your technical base is stable and security questions are taken into account (with dedicated features), as long as licensing questions.
Up to date: AFS is maintained to the latest version of technology that do not compromise previous arguments.
