console.category = Connection
console.label = LDAP Connection
console.text = This page allows you to define mapping between user attributes and LDAP objects. These correspondences will be used to import or export users from your LDAP server.\n\nMapping values can be an LDAP attribute name or a constant. If a constant is used, then any imported user will be defined using this value. Constants are integers (e.g. 12), booleans (true or false) and any string surrounded by "quotes". Multiple values can be separated with spaces, so if the map defines a list of attributes and ends with a constant, this constant will be used as the default value.\n\nTo map users from your LDAP you need to first define the connection to the LDAP server.  A "Powered LDAP user" must be defined because they need to be able to list the other LDAP users. If you use a powered user, then the application IHM will be able to display the LDAP logins in the create user form. The import page will also be available to automatically import existing LDAP users to the local database.\n\nIf you want to use a direct authentication process, leave the Powered User login blank, in this case you will not allow the server to push users into the LDAP directory.
console.mapping.text = Define the default values for the LDAP mappings.  
console.mapping.label = LDAP Mappings

test= Test Connection

Server = LDAP Server Identification
SU = Powered User
Searchparam = Search Parameters
SSL = SSL Connection
Misc = Other Parameters

host = Host name
host.help = LDAP Server Host Name or IP Address.
port = Port number
login = Login
login.help = Powered user login to LDAP Server (optional). This login must be a user with the ability to list other users from the LDAP tree. This login is required for the import and export process.
password = Password
user.forcebinding = Force user binding to login
password.modify = Users can change their own LDAP passwords
dn.attribute = LDAP Login Attribute
dn.attribute.help = This parameter is required if an administrative login is used (or for import export processes).
dn.base      = Base Distinguished Name
dn.base.help = LDAP Object UID from where users are stored.
dn.password  = LDAP Password Attribute
dn.password.help = This parameter is required if an administrative login is used (or for import export processes).
dn.search    = Search Pattern
dn.search.help = This field is used only if a powered user Login is defined. It is used to search the current user login into the LDAP tree. This pattern must follow the LDAP syntax filters and use a '%s' tag where the user login is matched. For instance the default filter used, if this field is left empty, is '(userPrincipalName=%s)' or '(uid=%s)'
password.simple = Use simple Password encoding
attributes.expired = LDAP Password Expired Attribute
attributes.expired.help = This parameter is optional, use spaces to separate if there is more than one attribute to test.
attributes.locked  = LDAP locked Attribute
attributes.locked.help = This parameter is optional, use spaces to separate if there is more than one attribute to test.
attributes.timemap = LDAP Time map Attribute
attributes.timemap.help = This parameter is optional, use spaces to separate if there is more than one attribute to test.
ssl.keystore.path = KeyStore Path
ssl.keystore.path.help = KeyStore file path that contains the LDAP Server certificates. Leave this empty if no SSL connection is required.
ssl.type = Activate the StartTLS sub protocol.
ssl.type.help = The StartTLS sub protocol use the same protocol port number than LDAP but encrypt the LDAP connection after the connection.   
timeout = Operation Timeout
user.class = LDAP User object class
user.class.help = LDAP Object class used to create User during export processes.
user.dnpattern = LDAP User DN
user.dnpattern.help = This Pattern is used to create Users in the LDAP tree. It will be used to build the object's distinguished name.\nUse %1$s for the login value, %2$d for the user internal ID (numeric) and %3$s for client code.
user.forcebinding = Force binded User to login.
user.forcebinding.help = If a Powered Login is given here then Users do not login to the LDAP server, authentication uses the administrative login to check password. In some cases (right access, or LDAP server type) you must force user binding to perform the "authentication".

EmptyServer = \nEmpty server Host name.
ServerConnected = \nServer successfully contacted.\n
Binded = \nBinded to the Server.\n
BindAnonymous = \nAnonymous binding used.
EmptyBDN = \nThe Base distinguished name is empty.
LoginEmptyNoSelection = \nThe login attribute is empty. Login selection is impossible.
EmptyLogin = \nLogin selection is empty.
EmptyEntry = \nEmpty entry selected...
ConnectionTest = LDAP Connection Test
ListedObjects = \n%d objects listed.\n
ObjectWithNoAttribute = \nObject with no Login attribute selected.
